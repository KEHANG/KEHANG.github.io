Hi there, I am a Senior Research Engineer at [Google DeepMind](https://research.google/people/KehangHan/), with a current focus on generative modeling and discrete diffusion (see our latest work [MD4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04329) and [AR2Diff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17181)).

Previously, I completed [my PhD](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/121892) on complex systems, chemistry and ML at MIT. Then I spent one year in [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain) as an AI resident (2020-21), working with [Science team](https://research.google/teams/applied-science/) and [Reliable Deep Learning team](https://research.google/blog/towards-reliability-in-deep-learning-systems/).

I'm broadly interested in deep learning, [probabilistic ML](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html), language modeling, [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) and [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things). In the past I have made contributions to projects: [Gemini](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805), [RT-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15818), [T5X](https://github.com/google-research/t5x), [Plex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07411) and [RMG](https://rmg.mit.edu/).
